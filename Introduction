The Eternus 2000 SAN is normally used in industry grade server rooms and for situation where redundancy is needed as well as speed. Because of this you normally 
will not see amateurs with SAN's trying to set one up. This guide will contain some of the problems and soultions I ran into setting up Fujitsu's Eternus 2000.
Unforchanetly because I did not get this SAN New, it wasn't plug and play. I knew there was one bad drive and the array had failed. Meaning I could not just set everything
up and go. I am also not an expert in this field, I am a college student figuring out how all of this works. In this I will document my mistakes and the way I worked around
them. 

Getting started is definitly a harder than using a raspberry pi. You'll need the following:
A SAN (Storage Area Network)
A Fibre/iSCI/or SAS HBA
Cables to match
Time

This project took multiple weeks of research and troubleshooting to get working properly, don't take this guide and think you will have it up in under an hour.
First things first, Documentation; 
Futjitsu Models: https://www.fujitsu.com/global/support/products/computing/storage/manuals-list.html

I have a Futjisu Eternus 2000 Model 200; 
This model is older and requires alot of searching to find the required drivers and set up.
Before getting into the SAN server its worth mentioning that a Windows Server 2012 R2 Command and Control Server was set up with remote desktop functions and automated 
backups were configured.
